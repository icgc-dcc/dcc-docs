Application for access to these data can be submitted to \nICGC's Data Access and Compliance Office (DACO)\n.\n\n\nRaw sequencing and other primary data\n\n\nICGC member projects are required by ICGC policies to submit their raw sequencing reads and other primary data, to controlled access public repositories. The official ICGC DCC-supported repository for \nICGC sequencing reads\n is the European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI) \nEuropean Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)\n. For the ICGC member projects which are part of the U.S. \nTCGA\n project, raw data will be hosted either at the \nTCGA DCC\n or the \nCancer Genomics Hub (CGHub)\n.\n\n\nAnalyzed germline data\n\n\nAnalyzed germline data are hosted at the ICGC DCC and accessible through the \nICGC Data Portal\n. Analyzed germline data include variants in cancer donors' normal genomes, such as simple germline variations (SGV), and a very small portion of the simple somatic mutations (SSM) that could leak germline information, ie, alleles that are not in concordance with human reference genome. These SSMs are censored through the \ngermline data masking\n process. Censored SSMs will then be made publicly accessible while original unmasked SSMs are only accessible to DACO approved users.\n\n\nPCAWG Data (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genome) \n\n\nThe PCAWG data set consists of uniformly aligned (by BWA-MEM) sample-level BAM files, plus sets of germline variant and somatic mutation data (in VCF format) produced by PCAWG core pipelines. Some uniformly aligned RNA-Seq data for matched genomic data are also available.\n\n\nPCAWG data are stored in individual GNOS repositories hosted at different academic centres globally. To improve accessibility some data entries have been synchronized among GNOS repositories.\n\n\n\n\nYou can browse and search for PCAWG data files on ICGC Data Portal - Repository Browser \nhttps://dcc.icgc.org/repositories\n.\n\n\nFor actual data download, you will need to apply for data access via ICGC DACO for non-TCGA portion of the ICGC data, and via dbGAP for TCGA portion.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on ICGC/TCGA PCWAG Status, please go to .\n\nPlease note: PCAWG data set is currently restricted to the researchers who are part of the PCAWG study and will be open to the broader community at the end of the study.",

We downloaded files with gene, transcript, translation, exon, xref, and domain etc data, built a document-oriented data store with essential gene information. We then further integrated gene summary information downloaded from NCBI Entrez Gene. This gene document is then integrated with somatic mutation datasets based on mutation consequence annotation (described in the next section) results.\n\n\nMutation consequence annotation\n\n\nAs part of the effort to enable cross cancer projects functional analysis, we perform standardized gene consequences annotation, using Sequence Ontology's controlled vocabulary regarding mutation-induced changes (\nwww.sequenceontology.org\n). This type of annotation provides a list of predicted gene effects, such as a non-conservative amino acid substitution, but does not attempt to prioritize the changes by their functional impact. Simple somatic mutation data submitted by member projects are annotated using the variant annotation tool SnpEff (v3.3c, ) recommended by the ICGC Mutation Consequences and Pathways (MUCOPA) Working Subgroup (Nature Methods, 2013, PMID:\n23900255\n).\n\n\nMutation function impact prediction\n\n\nIn order to assess functional impact of non-synonymous (SO term: \nmissense_variant\n) somatic mutations on protein coding genes, we used well-known prediction tools (currently \nFatHMM\n, with more to be added such as \nMutation Assessor\n and \nSIFT\n) to compute functional impact scores and assign impact categories. ICGC DCC defines the following four categories: \nHigh\n, \nMedium\n, \nLow\n and \nUnknown\n.\n\n\nWe first compute original impact prediction with these different tools for all simple somatic mutations (\nSSM\n) that cause \nmissense\n consequence, each mutation is expressed at amino acid level, e.g., \nENSP00000358548 Q61R\n to feed into individual functional impact prediction tools. When a mutation affects multiple splice forms of the same gene, prediction will be performed on all of them whenever possible. For a particular mutation, using a simple rule-based approach, predictions for each transcript isoform reported by different tools will then be summarized to a single impact category. The rule is straightforward: the highest impact category will be picked up from results of all tools. When no prediction is reported, \nUnknown\n is assigned.\n\n\nFor all other SSMs that cause consequence other than \nmissense\n, impact category will be assigned based on consequence type a mutation causes. \nHigh\n impact will be assigned for \nframeshift_variant, non_conservative_missense_variant, initiator_codon_variant, stop_gained\n and \nstop_lost\n, \nUnknown\n will be assigned for all other mutations.\n\n\nSimple somatic mutation frequencies\n\n\nIn order to assess how often a particular simple somatic mutation (SSM) occurs in cancer patients, we establishes specific criteria to determine whether SSMs reported from different donors are considered to be the same. When all of these fields from two reported SSMs: chromosome, chromosome start, chromosome end, mutation type, DNA change, genome assembly version are identical, they are merged into one mutation entity. With this, we build a non-redundant collection of all simple somatic mutations. Each mutation entry in the collection is assigned a stable identifier for persisted referencing portal wide and across releases. Information for linking these non-redundant SSMs to the reported ones is also kept, enabling mutation counts across donors.\n\n\nGermline data masking\n\n\nWhen a somatic mutation falls on the same position as a germline SNP, there is potential to leak a small amount of germline data. To prevent this, as of Release 15, ICGC DCC will be censoring the patient's germline genotype in the case where it does not match the reference genome allele:\n\n\n\n\nthe mutated allele from control genotype will be replaced with the reference gernome allele when we publish to the open-access tier.\n\n\nthe germline genotype that was censored will be flagged internally and the patient's true genotype will only be available to researchers' with access to controlled tier.\n\n\n\n\nUpon a valid submission, a report will be generated indicating the total number of submitted simple somatic mutation observations, and the total number of controlled access simple somatic mutation observations:\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of the submitted SSM observations\n\n\nNumber of SSMs marked as controlled (containing germline data)\n\n\nPercentage of observations marked as controlled\n\n\n\n\nExample of open access simple somatic mutation:\n\n\n\n\nThe alleles in the control_genotype match the reference_genome_allele.

The feature is best utilized through the use diverse filters provided, allowing the user to narrow down on projects throughout the repositories.\n\n\nBrowser\n\n\nThe browser is made up of multiple parts, including \nFilter Facets\n, \nResults\n, \nBAM statistics\n, \nManifests\n, and \nDonor Sets\n. \n\n\n\n\nFiltering\n\n\nICGC data is filtered through the use of facets, much like \nAdvanced Search\n and \nProjects\n. Users can use the facets to check off desired attributes within a project file, and all the files with that attribute will be returned. Filters within the same facet, and across multiple facets can be overlapped. The two types of filters are \nDonor Filters\n and \nFile Filters\n.\n\n\nDonor Filters\n\n\nDonor Filters correspond to facets that will filter by the donor's attributes. These filters are used if the user is looking for \ndonors\n of a certain characteristic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by File ID, File Name or Object ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by a list of repositories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by the Data Type of the file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by the Experimental Strategy of the file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by files in certain studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by the format of the file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by the analysis software used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by whether or not the file is controlled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Filters\n\n\nFile Filters correspond to facets that will filter by the file's attributes.

Each file entity has a Manifest per repository, and can be downloaded on the \nFile Copies\n section.\n\n\nIf the situation comes up where more than one file is needed, the \nDownload manifests\n button can be used to download all the selected files, or if none are selected, all the files. The result would be a single Manifest file for each repository, containing all the files that belonged to that repository and were selected.\n\n\n\n\nSelected 4(four) out of 7(seven) files in the same repository.\n\n\n\nOnly one Manifest file because the 4(four) files were in the same repository.\n\n\nNote\n\nFor repositories such as Collaboratory and AWS, the Manifest ID is enough to download the requested files. For more detail on downloading these two files, click \nhere\n\n\nDonor Sets\n\n\nA user has the ability to save a list of donors, using the \"SAVE DONOR SET\" feature.

            "text": "Cloud Guide\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis user guide describes the steps to securely explore and analyze ICGC data stored in \nAmazon (\nAWS\n)\n or \nCollaboratory (\nOpenStack\n)\n cloud environments. For more information about ICGC cloud initiatives, please see \nICGC in the Cloud\n.\n\n\nPlease see \nTerms\n for a glossary of terms used in this guide.\n\n\nProcess\n\n\nThe figure below illustrates the overall process and systems involved:\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n    Apply for DACO \nCloud Access\n if not already approved\n    Upon approval, login to the \nData Portal\n\n    Generate an \nAccess Token\n for cloud download\n\n\nCompute Prerequistes\n\n    Provision a \nCompute Instance\n in the target cloud\n\n\nInstallation\n\n    Download and install the ICGC \nStorage Client\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n    Configure the Storage Client to use the generated Access Token\n\n\nFile Search\n\n    Identify files of interest using the Data Portal\n\n\nStorage Client Usage\n\n    Download or view data with the provided Storage Client or via an external tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subsequent sections will provide additional details on each of these topics.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nThe usage of the distributed \nStorage Client\n is required to provide additional security while operating in participating cloud environments and to enhance user download speeds.\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nSecurity is enforced by a coordinating ICGC storage server. The client communicates with the server which brokers downloads and converts ICGC Access Tokens into Amazon \npre-signed urls\n. Once a successful authorization handshake between the client and the server is established, downloads will be transferred directly from \nS3\n to the client, maintaining fast access to the data.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the provided software only functions within the \nus-east-1\n EC2 region of AWS located in Northern Virginia, U.S. where the data is physically stored. Attempting to use the software outside of this region will be denied data access.\n\n\nCollaboratory\n\n\nDownloads only function inside Collaboratory's OpenStack environment.\n\n\nLastly, it is the user\u2019s responsibility to protect the data after it has been attained. This includes any subsequent analyses and storage on cloud and downstream resources.\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n\nThere are two prerequesites to using the Storage Client: DACO Cloud Access status and a self-provisioned Access Token.\n\n\nDACO Cloud Access\n\n\nDACO Cloud Access is prerequisite to using the Storage Client. To apply for DACO access please follow the instructions provided at \nhttps://icgc.org/daco\n. Once approved, you will be able to \nlogin\n to the Data Portal to generate an \nAccess Token\n. To login, click on the \u201cLogin\u201d link in the upper right-hand corner of the page. When prompted, choose to login with either your \nICGC.org login\n or one of the supported OpenID providers (e.g. Google). After successful authentication, you will know that you have Cloud Access to the controlled tier if the \u201clogin\u201d link is replaced with a green cloud icon ().\n\n\nAccess Tokens\n\n\nThe Access Token model used for protecting the cloud data set follows a similar process to Github\u2019s \npersonal access tokens\n. Tokens are used instead of a username / password to securely access ICGC resources.\n\n\nRelated to Access Tokens is the concept of \nScopes\n. Tokens allow you to associate Scopes which limit access to that needed for the target environment. This enhances security by following the \nPrinciple of Least Privilege\n. Cloud specific Scopes will become available after acquiring DACO Cloud Access. An instance of a cloud download token will grant access to all of the available data in that environment.\n\n\nToken Manager\n\n\nTo acquire an Access Token, you must first obtain DACO Clould Access and login to the Data Portal. After a successful login, there will be \nToken Manager\n link in the upper right corner of the page. Clicking on this link will display the Token Manager dialog:\n\n\n\n\nFrom this dialog, you can manage the Access Tokens associated with your account. Importantly, you may delete and regenerate an access token if you believe that it has been compromised.\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating an Access Token, you will need to specify the Scope associated with the target cloud(s).\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nIn the case of the ICGC AWS data set, an access token with the \naws.download\n scope is required to access the \ncontrolled access data\n\n\nCollaboratory\n\n\nIn the case of the ICGC Collaboratory data set, an access token with the \ncollab.download\n scope is required to access the \ncontrolled access data\n\n\nYou can verify that your Access Token has the desired scopes by inspecting it in the table at the bottom of the dialog. For security purposes, Access Tokens must remain private and not be shared with anyone.\n\n\nFollowing the creation of a Compute Instance, discussed in the next section, you will need to edit the Storage Client client configuration file to include the generated Access Token. See the \nConfiguration\n section for additional information.\n\n\nCompute Prerequisites\n\n\nCompute Instance\n\n\nAs a first step in analyzing data, you will need to create a Compute Instance to run the Storage Client and any other supporting software.\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nIn order to run within \nEC2\n, you will need your own AWS account to provision a running EC2 instance. Any data processing will be charged to this account. Note that ICGC data download from S3 to the same EC2 region is free of charge. Please see Amazon's documentation for detailed instructions.\n\n\nCollaboratory\n\n\nIn order to run within \nCollaboratory\n, you will need to be enrolled. To begin the enrollment process, please send an email to \nhelp@cancercollaboratory.org\n.\n\n\nThe following sections provide guidance on selecting and configuring the chosen instance type.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nAs data files are quite large, users should have enough local disk space to store files downloaded from the remote repository.\n\n\nMore processing cores will give greater parallelism, and therefore, better thoughput of downloads.\n\n\nBy default the storage client is configured to use a maximum of 3G of RAM. Most of time this is more than sufficient.\n\n\nOperating System\n\n\nThe Storage Client has been designed to work on modern Mac and Linux distributions. Windows should work as well but remains untested.\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nThe Storage Client requires Java 8 to be installed. It has been tested using the Oracle distribution. The procedure for installing Java 8 will vary depending on the operating system and package manager used.\n\n\nIn order to use the mount feature, \nFUSE\n is required. On most Linux based systems this will require installing \nlibfuse-dev\n and \nfuse\n packages.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThis section describes how to install the Storage Client. The are two options: (a) from a tarball and (b) from a Docker image hosted on Dockerhub.\n\n\nInstall from Tarball\n\n\nTo begin using the Storage Client, the first step is to download the distribution. The latest version can be downloaded from \nhere\n.\n\n\nwget -O icgc-storage-client.tar.gz https://dcc.icgc.org/api/v1/ui/software/icgc-storage-client/latest\ntar -xvzf icgc-storage-client.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\nAfter untaring the archive, the Storage Client will be available at \nbin/icgc-storage-client\n. Steps to verify the authenticity and integrity of the download can be found on our \nsoftware\n page.\n\n\nInstall from Docker Image\n\n\nWe also support a Docker image of the Storage Client that is bundled with Java 8 for easy deployment.\n\n\nThe image is hosted at \nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/icgc/icgc-storage-client/\n and downloaded by issuing the following command:\n\n\ndocker pull icgc/icgc-storage-client\n\n\n\n\nOnce pulled, you can open a shell in the container by executing:\n\n\ndocker run -it icgc/icgc-storage-client\n\n\n\n\nThere is no entry point or command defined for the image. The software may be located at \n/icgc/icgc-storage-client\n which is also the working directory of the container. All other steps for \nusing the Storage Client\n will be the same for both Docker and tarball installations.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe configuration of the Storage Client is stored in the \nconf/application.properties\n file of the distribution.\n\n\nAccess Configuration\n\n\nThe main configuration element is the access token generated in \nAccess Token\n above. Configuration is stored in the \nconf/\n directory of the distribution.\n\n\nEdit \napplication.properties\n and add the generated accesss token to the line:\n\n\naccessToken=\naccess token\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using Docker, this can also be set with an environmental variable:\n\n\ndocker run -it -e ACCESSTOKEN=\naccess token\n icgc/icgc-storage-client\n\n\n\n\nCollaboratory\n\n\nIn addition to the above, you will need to change the \nbin/icgc-storage-client\n script to set \nSTORAGE_PROFILE=collab\n. This can also performed externally via the environmental variable of the same name. Note that it is also possible to override this per execution using \nbin/icgc-storage-client\n's \n--profile collab\n argument.\n\n\nTransport Configuration\n\n\nBased on the target Compute Instance defined in \nCompute Prerequisites\n and transfer speed requirements, it may be necessary to make changes to how the Storage Client transfers data. This is achieved by setting \ntransport.parallel\n and \ntransport.memory\n:\n\n\n\n\ntransport.parallel\n controls the number of concurrent threads for multi-part data transfers. It is recommended to set this to the number of cores of the Compute Instance.\n\n\ntransport.memory\n is the amount of non-heap memory per thread, in gigabytes. It is recommended set this to a value of \n1\n (1 GB). Be sure to leave enough memory for the operating system and any other software that may be running on the Compute Instance.\n\n\n\n\nFile Search\n\n\nFinding files of interest can be done via the Data Portal. Objects are identified by their \nObject ID\n.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nrepository file search\n\n\nClick on the \nAWS\n or \nCollaboratory\n filter in the left hand pane\n\n\nFilter based on properties of interest (e.g. donor id, specimen id, etc.)\n\n\nExport a \nManifest\n for future use with the Storage Client\n\n\n\n\nThe Manifest is the main way to define what files should be downloaded by the Storage Client. However, knowing the Object ID is sufficient for a single file download. To generate a Manifest, click on the \"Download manifests\" link the the Data Repository browser. You will be prompted with a \"Download manifests\" dialog:\n\n\n\n\nManifests downloaded from the Data Portal can be transferred to the Storage Client instance by using SFTP or SCP. For convenience, it is also possible to use a Manifest ID saved on the Data Portal by clicking on the \"Manifest ID\" button. See the \nStorage Client Usage\n section for usage information.\n\n\nStorage Client Usage\n\n\nThis section provides information on how to use the Storage Client once it has been properly downloaded and configured. It assumes the user possesses and has configured the requisite access token discussed previously.\n\n\nThe Storage Client has the general syntax:\n\n\nicgc-storage-client [options] [command] [command options]\n\n\n\n\nIt offers a set of commands, where each command has its own set of options to influence its operation.\n\n\nHelp\n\n\nThe Storage Client provides a \n--help\n option to list the available commands and a brief description of their supported options:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client --help\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to get information on a specific command using the \nhelp\n command:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client help download\n\n\n\n\nURL Command\n\n\nThe \nurl\n command is the most basic command supported by the Storage Client. It allows one to resolve the underyling S3 URL for the requested object. This is useful if one wants to directly access the URL via HTTPS with an external client or tool (e.g. \ncurl\n, \nwget\n, etc.)\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client url --object-id ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd\n\n\n\n\nAn example of using \nwget\n:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client url --object-id \nObject ID\n\nResolving URL for object: ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd (offset = 0, length = -1)\nhttps://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/snip\n\n\nwget https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/snip\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Command\n\n\nThe \ndownload\n command allows fast parallel download of remote objects. It can be run in one of two modes: (a) single object mode and (b) Manifest driven mode\n\n\nNote that the Storage Client is able to resume an interrupted download session. Simply rerun the same command again and it will continue.\n\n\nSingle Object\n\n\nThis mode is most useful when downloading a single object given a known Object ID, perhaps acquired from the Data Portal:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client download --object-id ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd --output-dir data\n\n\n\n\nDownloads will be stored in the \n--output-dir\n.\n\n\nManifest\n\n\nUsing a Manifest is ideal for downloading multiple files identified through the Data Portal. The \nrepository file search\n allows one to generate a Manifest file that can be supplied for bulk downloading files. It also provides some additional metadata for selected files that gives the donor, specimen and sample context.\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client download --manifest manifest.txt --output-dir data\n\n\n\n\nThe optional \n--output-layout\n option can be used to organize the downloads into a couple of predefined directory layouts. See the \n--help\n for addional information.\n\n\nManifest Command\n\n\nThe \nmanifest\n command allows a user to quickly view the contents of a download Manifest produced by the Data Portal. A Manifest can come from:\n\n\n\n\nThe local file system\n\n\nA Manifest ID that is hosted on the Data Portal\n\n\nAny URL\n\n\n\n\nA Manifest is a TSV file that contains both file identifying fields and satellite metadata for understanding the relationships to other data including donor, project and study.\n\n\nManifest from a Local File\n\n\nAn example of using a local file system Manifest:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client manifest --manifest manifest.aws-virginia.1444232116728.txt\n\n\n\n\nManifest from the Data Portal\n\n\nAn example of using a Data Portal hosted Manifest:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client manifest --manifest 49e91614-7811-11e5-8a58-34363bcf803c\n\n\n\n\nManifest from a URL\n\n\nAn example of using a URL hosted Manifest:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client manifest --manifest http://hastebin.com/raw/ujajodilih\n\n\n\n\nView Command\n\n\nThe \nview\n command is a minimal version of \nsamtools view\n. It allows to request a \u201cgenomic slice\u201d of the remote BAM file, freeing the user from having to download the entire file locally, saving bytes and time.\n\n\nThe following example will download reads overlapping the region 1 - 100000 in chromosome 1:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client view --object-id ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd --query 1:1-100000\n\n\n\n\nThe BAI is automatically discovered and streamed as part of the operation.\n\n\nFor quickly accessing the only the BAM header one can issue:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client view --header-only --object-id ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to pipe the output of the above to \nsamtools\n, etc. for pipelining a workflow:\n\n\nbin/icgc-storage-client view --object-id ddcdd044-adda-5f09-8849-27d6038f8ccd | samtools mpileup -\n\n\n\n\nMount Command\n\n\nThe \nmount\n command can be used to mount the remote S3 bucket as a read-only \nFUSE\n file system. This is very useful to browse and explore the available files, as well as quickly see their size and date of modification using common commands such as \nls\n, \nfind\n, \ndu\n and \ntree\n. It also works very well with standard analysis tools such as \nsamtools\n.\n\n\nFiles are organized into a virtual directory structure. The following shows the default \nbundle\n layout:\n\n\n/bundleId1/fileName1\n/bundleId1/fileName2\n...\n/bundleId1/fileNamei\n...\n/bundleIdn/fileName1\n/bundleIdn/fileName2\n...\n/bundleIdn/fileNamej\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nbundleId\n and \nfileName\n are the original \nBundle ID\n and file name of the file respectively. It possible to control the layout using the \n--layout\n option. Using \n--layout object-id\n will instead produce a flat list of files named by their associated Object ID.\n\n\nThe file system implementation's performance is optimized for serial reads. Frequent random access patterns will lead to very poor performance. Under the covers, each random seek requires a new HTTP connection to S3 with the appropriate \nRange\n header set which is an expensive operation. For this reason, it is only recommended for streaming analysis (e.g. \nsamtools view\n like functionality).\n\n\nMount All Files\n\n\nTo mount all available files locally, issue the following:\n\n\n# Create the mount point\nmkdir /mnt/icgc\n\n# Mount\nbin/icgc-storage-client mount --mount-point /mnt/icgc\n\n\n\n\nTo speed up subsequent mounts, one can specify the \n--cache-metadata\n flag above which will locally store an index of the file system.\n\n\nOnce mounted, you can use standard analysis tools against files found under the mount point:\n\n\n# Slice\nsamtools view /mnt/icgc/fff75930-0f8c-4c99-9b48-732e7ed4c625/443a7a6ab964e41c011cc9a303bc086c.bam 1:10000-20000\n\n\n\n\nMount Only Manifest Entries\n\n\nTo filter the mount to only include the files specified in a Manifest, issue the following:\n\n\n# Create the mount point\nmkdir /mnt/icgc\n\n# Mount\nbin/icgc-storage-client mount --mount-point /mnt/icgc --manfiest manifest\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nmanifest\n command for more details on how to specify a Manifest.\n\n\nMount in Docker\n\n\nTo avoid having to install the FUSE and Java dependencies when working with the \nmount\n command, it is very convenient to mount from within a Docker container. This is also useful for creating a custom image for analysis that derives from the one published by ICGC. First, ensure that Docker and the Storage Client image is installed. See the \nInstallation\n section for details.\n\n\nNext, export the access token generated from the portal:\n\n\n# Export access token\nexport ACCESSTOKEN=accessToken\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then mount the file system inside the container against the empty \n/mnt\n directory:\n\n\n# Alias for ease of use\nalias icgc-storage-client=\ndocker run -it --rm -e ACCESSTOKEN --privileged icgc/icgc-storage-client bin/icgc-storage-client\n\n\n\n\n\n# Mount the file system in the container\nicgc-storage-client mount --mount-point /mnt\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \n--privileged\n Docker option is required for FUSE in order to access the host's \n/dev/fuse\n device.\n\n\nIn another terminal, you can access the newly mounted file system:\n\n\n# List all files recursively\ndocker exec -it $(docker ps -lq) find /mnt\n\n\n\n\nTo perform analysis within the container:\n\n\n# Open a shell in the previously created container\ndocker exec -it $(docker ps -lq) bash\n\n# Install samtools\napt-get install samtools\n\n# Slice\nsamtools view /mnt/fff75930-0f8c-4c99-9b48-732e7ed4c625/443a7a6ab964e41c011cc9a303bc086c.bam 1:10000-20000\n\n\n\n\nDue to a limitation of Docker it is not possible to access a FUSE mounted file system from the host operating system. Please see \nhere\n for more details.\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nWhere can I find the Bundle ID associated with an Object ID?\n\n\nCurrently the only way to retrieve the Bundle ID of an Object ID is by viewing the file entity page in the Data Portal. Navigate to the Data Repository browser and enter the Object ID in the \"File\" filter and click on the resulting record.\n\n\nWhere are detailed Storage Client logs stored?\n\n\nThe Storage Client log file is stored at \nlogs/client.log\n\n\nHow long will pre-signed URLs remain valid?\n\n\nPre-signed URLs are valid for 1 day from the time they are issued. For security purposes, a URL issued to one user must not be used by another and must be kept private.\n\n\nDoes the client maintain state?\n\n\nYes, the client maintains state in the working directory in a hidden file \n.\nObject ID\n/meta\n. This file includes cached pre-signed URLS. If your downloads fail unexpectedly, then try deleting this directory to purge pre-signed URLs that may have expired. Also, when using the \nmount\n command with the \n--cache-metadata\n option, \n.entities.cache\n and \n.objects.cache\n are stored in the current working directory.\n\n\nWhy do I get a security exception when I try to download an object?\n\n\nIf you are targeting the AWS cloud, ensure that you are running within the \nus-east-1\n \nregion\n. If you are targeting Collaboratory, make sure you are inside the OpenStack environment.\n\n\nI can\u2019t use the result of a \nurl\n command with \nsamtools\n:\n\n\nsamtools\n doesn\u2019t support the HTTPS protocol\n*\n, which is required by ICGC to access S3-stored data files. Use the client \nview\n command to pipe data to samtools, download the desired files locally, or use the mount command to create a FUSE mount of the ICGC data files.\n\n\n*\n \nUpdate\n: As of commit \nfe1f08a\n \nsamtools\n now supports file access over HTTPS and Amazon S3.\n\n\nHow do I report a bug in the software?\n\n\nPlease contact \ndcc-support@icgc.org\n and include the version of the software in the body of the message (\nbin/icgc-storage-client --version\n).\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nRelated terms and their defintions are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Token\n\n\nAn authorization mechanism created by the \nData Portal\n to access data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBundle ID\n\n\nAn identifier that refers to a submission bundle of related files.

This is very useful to browse and explore the available files, as well as quickly see their size and date of modification using common commands such as  ls ,  find ,  du  and  tree . It also works very well with standard analysis tools such as  samtools .  Files are organized into a virtual directory structure. The following shows the default  bundle  layout:  /bundleId1/fileName1\n/bundleId1/fileName2\n...\n/bundleId1/fileNamei\n...\n/bundleIdn/fileName1\n/bundleIdn/fileName2\n...\n/bundleIdn/fileNamej  where  bundleId  and  fileName  are the original  Bundle ID  and file name of the file respectively. It possible to control the layout using the  --layout  option. Using  --layout object-id  will instead produce a flat list of files named by their associated Object ID.  The file system implementation's performance is optimized for serial reads. Frequent random access patterns will lead to very poor performance. Under the covers, each random seek requires a new HTTP connection to S3 with the appropriate  Range  header set which is an expensive operation. For this reason, it is only recommended for streaming analysis (e.g.  samtools view  like functionality).",

            "text": "Data Submission FAQ\n\n\n1. How do I upload my files to the submission system?\n\n\nBefore using the web-based submission system, you must upload your submission files to the SFTP server. Logging into the web submission system can be accomplished using your existing project SFTP account and password. For more details, visit the \nFile Submission\n page.\n\n\n2. Where can I find that latest DCC data file specification?\n\n\nYou can find the latest DCC data file specification and Release notes \nhere\n.\n\n\n3. How do I put my submission files together?\n\n\nSubmission files must follow the rules in the DCC Data File specification. More details about submission file format can be found \nhere\n\n\n4. How do I submit information about a simple somatic mutation?\n\n\nExamples of the format required for mutations can be found \nhere\n. Note, this is not a new format and has always been enforced by ICGC.\n\n\n5. Where do I find the Release Notes showing changes between the last DCC data file specification and the current DCC data file specification?\n\n\nThe latest dictionary Release Notes can be found \nhere\n\n\n6. What assembly version do you use?\n\n\nICGC DCC uses hg19 (GrCh37).\n\n\n7. How do I get the JSON format of the DCC data file specification?\n\n\nPlease refer to the \nSubmission API\n which documents how to retrieve the data specification in JSON format via REST webservices.\n\n\n8. What do -777 and -888 mean? How do I use them?\n\n\n-777 and -888 are reserve codes accepted by ICGC for data elements where the data is verified to be unknown, or the information is not applicable. Details and examples can be found \nhere\n\n\n9. I got an error message during validation that I don't understand! How do I get more details?\n\n\nOnce validation is complete, you will be able to view a report generated by the submission system which gives details about errors. In addition, please refer to the \"Script\" section of the data file specification tables for each data type, which explain cross-field restrictions. If you encounter an error message you do not understand, please contact \ndcc-support@icgc.org\n.\n\n\n10. I can't log into the submission system. I think I forgot my username/password. How do I retrieve it?\n\n\nThe submission system will lock a user out if a password is entered incorrectly three times. Should you find yourself locked out, or if you have forgotten your password, please contact \ndcc-support@icgc.org\n and we will reset it for you.\n\n\n11. How do I obtain the accession number required for the \"raw_data_accession\" field?\n\n\nWhen you submit your raw sequencing data to EGA's EBI repository, EGA will supply you with an accession number. You will need to use this accession number to populate the \nraw_data_accession\n field in the submission files.\n\n\n12. Why do I have to submit my raw data to EBI's EGA repository before submitting data to ICGC DCC?\n\n\nICGC member projects are required by ICGC policies to submit their raw sequencing reads, and other primary data, to controlled access public repositories. The official ICGC DCC-supported repository for \nICGC sequencing reads\n is the European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI) \nEuropean Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)\n.\n\n\n13. What does open and controlled access mean?\n\n\nOpen access refers to all data that is publicly available in the portal without restrictions. Controlled access refers to protected data, such as germline SNPs, that requires user certification for access. For more information on how to access controlled tier data in the ICGC Data Portal and data deposited to the EGA, please contact \nDACO\n.\n\n\n14. What language are the cross-field validation scripts written in?\n\n\nThe cross-field validation scripts are implemented in \nMVEL\n\n\n15. Can I submit just clinical data without experimental data to ICGC?\n\n\nPlease be advised that donors, specimen, and analyzed_samples with no associated experimental results will be ignored and not reported DCC Data Portal release.\n\n\n16. What are \"percentage_of_cellularity\" and \"level_of_cellularity\" fields in the Specimen and Analyzed Sample Data File data file specifications? Do I need to fill both in?\n\n\nCellularity is defined as the proportion of tumour nuclei to total number of nuclei in a given specimen or analyzed sample. The cellularity at the specimen level (ie. pathologist reported) could be different from the cellularity reported at the sample level (ie. using sequencing methods such as cell sorting). The two fields \"percentage_of_cellularity\" and \"level_of_cellularity\" record the same piece of information, but give the submitter the option to submit the information as either an integer value (percentage_of_cellularity) or a range of percentages (level_of_cellularity). An example would be in the case where a pathologist can only specify the cellularity of a specimen to be within a certain range (40-50% for example), then the \"level_of_cellularity\" data element could be populated with \"3\" (which defines 41-60% in the controlled vocabulary table), and \"percentage_of_cellularity\" could be populated with \"-888\" (not applicable).",

            "text": "File Submission\n\n\nImportant Notes\n\n\nIncremental Submission is a new feature offered by the submission system that allows you to upload just new data files for the current release (instead of resubmitting files containing all of your previous data along with your new data). All your data from previous releases will be maintained in the system and get automatically copied into the current release. Additionally, submitters are now also able to download their actual submitted data from the submission system. This means that data submitters are in full control of their effective data set and can use the submission system as a canonical data store.\n\n\nTo aid submitters in managing their data as they see best, the dictionary now allows a looser naming convention for files. As a consequence, multiple files per file schema may be submitted. For example, the donor schema now allows submitters to name their files using a custom segment conforming to the following regular expression pattern:\n\n\n^donor(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?\\.txt(?:\\.gz|\\.bz2)?$\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, one could choose to adopt a donor.txt file naming system such as:\n\n\ndonor.01.txt, donor.02.txt, donor.03.txt, etc.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively one could embed the date that the file was created into the file's name:\n\n\ndonor.20130101.txt, donor.20130201.txt, donor.20130301.txt, etc.\n\n\n\n\nWith this scheme in place, a submitter can upload donor.20130101.txt in Release 1, donor.20130201.txt in Release 2 and donor.20130301.txt in Release 3. The effective submission for the current release will be the combined set of files. Note that in this current implementation each time a validation is performed it will validate the entire data set. However, in combination with Selective Validation the total validation time should be greatly reduced.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently downloading files from the SFTP server is disabled; the directory files are write-only.

All your data from previous releases will be maintained in the system and get automatically copied into the current release. Additionally, submitters are now also able to download their actual submitted data from the submission system. This means that data submitters are in full control of their effective data set and can use the submission system as a canonical data store.  To aid submitters in managing their data as they see best, the dictionary now allows a looser naming convention for files. As a consequence, multiple files per file schema may be submitted. For example, the donor schema now allows submitters to name their files using a custom segment conforming to the following regular expression pattern:  ^donor(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?\\.txt(?:\\.gz|\\.bz2)?$   For example, one could choose to adopt a donor.txt file naming system such as:  donor.01.txt, donor.02.txt, donor.03.txt, etc.  Alternatively one could embed the date that the file was created into the file's name:  donor.20130101.txt, donor.20130201.txt, donor.20130301.txt, etc.  With this scheme in place, a submitter can upload donor.20130101.txt in Release 1, donor.20130201.txt in Release 2 and donor.20130301.txt in Release 3. The effective submission for the current release will be the combined set of files. Note that in this current implementation each time a validation is performed it will validate the entire data set. However, in combination with Selective Validation the total validation time should be greatly reduced.

For example, in a diploid genome on chromosome 1 at position 12345, if one allele on the forward strand is A and the other is G, then the genotype is presented as A/G and 'chromosome_strand' being '1' (i.e. forward strand)\n\n\nIn the case that the genotype is hemizygous (e.g. G allele is missing), it can be presented as A/-.\n\n\n'control_genotype' and 'tumour_genotype' are used to record genotype for the matched control sample and the primary tumour sample, respectively. Both genotypes must be presented using the same strand of the reference genome.\n\n\n\n\nreference_genome_allele\n\n\n\n\n'reference_genome_allele' is the forward strand nucleotide(s) at the corresponding location on the reference genome where the somatic mutation is detected in the tumour sample.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I represent an insertion?\n\n\n\n\nUse the position of the nucleotide on the chromosome that is immediately \nafter\n the insertion point.

All data from previous releases will be maintained by the system and automatically copied to the current release. Additionally, submitters are now able to download their submitted data. This provides a model where submitters are in full control of their effective data set and can use the submission system as a canonical data store.\n\n\nFile Naming\n\n\nTo aid submitters in managing their data as they see best, the dictionary now allows a looser naming convention for files. As a consequence, multiple files per file schema may be submitted. For example, the donor schema now allows submitters to name their files using a custom segment conforming to the following regex:  \n\n\n^donor(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?\\.txt(?:\\.gz|\\.bz2)?$\n\n\n\n\n\nThus one may choose to adopt a naming scheme such as: \n\n\ndonor.01.txt, donor.02.txt, donor.03.txt\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively one could embed a date:\n\n\ndonor.20130101.txt, donor.20130201.txt, donor.20130301.txt`\n\n\n\n\nWith this scheme in place, a submitter can upload \ndonor.20130101.txt\n in Release 1, \ndonor.20130201.txt\n in Release 2 and \ndonor.20130301.txt\n in Release 3. The effective submission will be the combined set of files.  \n\n\nData Management\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure data remains consistent from release to release. In the case of deleted records, one must remove the records and their dependent records from all files and resubmit. The appropriate file split strategies should chosen by submitters to simplify operations between releases and interoperate with existing pipelines.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nIn the current implementation each time a validation is performed it will validate the entire data set. However, in combination with \n_Selective Validation\n_ the total validation time should be greatly reduced.",

Is NED (No Evidence of Disease) the same as complete_remission?\n\n\nNo. Please use \"no evidence of disease\" in the disease_status_last_followup field.\n\n\n2. What if response is unknown or there is some response but not sure about the classification according to RECIST?\n\n\nIf you are unable to classify the response, then please enter unknown. Please note that you may be contacted by PCAWG staff at a later date to clarify why this entry is unknown.\n\n\n3. What are the missing/unknown DCC reserve codes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-888\n\n\n\"not applicable\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-777\n\n\n\"data verified to be unknown\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'N/A Valid'\n indicates the field accepts -777 or -888 reserve codes\n\n\n'N/A Invalid'\n indicates the field does not accept -777 or -888 reserve codes. A valid value must be provided\n\n\n\n\nPlease see \nhere\n for more details.\n\n\n4. What should I enter if the answer to the question about relationship_age in the Donor Family table is unknown?\n\n\nThe dictionary allows \u201crelationship_age\u201d to be specified as \u201cN/A Valid\u201d. Therefore, you can submit one of the Missing/Unknown DCC Reserve Codes if the relationship_age is unknown.\n\n\n5. Can you please clarify what \u2018diagnosis\u2019 refers to in the Donor table? We have been using age at surgery to avoid (survival) biases when analyzing the data; however, if we use age at surgery then donor_age_at_diagnosis equals donor_age_at_enrollment. In addition, donor_tumour_stage_at_diagnosis would then be equal to tumour_stage.\n\n\nDiagnosis refers to the point of clinical diagnosis by the primary physician of the patient, (although diagnosis may not be official until surgery or biopsy is undertaken so this can be a little vague). In this context, age at diagnosis refers to the age at which the primary diagnosis was made and so age at enrolment would then equal age at surgery.\n\n\n6. Does the field \u201ctumour_confirmed\u201d in the Specimen table refer to a pathological confirmation of the presence of tumour?\n\n\nThis refers to the fact that a tumour has been confirmed as malignant by clinical means \u2013 usually this would be by histopathological review of the sample.\n\n\n7. For the smoking and alcohol variables requested in the Donor Exposure tables, some of this data may predate diagnosis and therefore a current smoker then may not be a current smoker at diagnosis. Are these variables supposed to reflect the status at the time of diagnosis, surgery? If so, then we may not have this for everyone (can be obtained via EPR online records but the data is not always so accurate in chart notes so we always use our questionnaire data if available).\n\n\nThe fields regarding exposure should reflect exposures prior to diagnosis. Please enter any available information and PCAWG staff will follow up with you following submission if anything is unclear.  \n\n\nWhat should I enter if the there are multiple answers to the first_therapy_type in the Donor table? For example, if the patient undertook pre-surgery Chemo to reduce Tumor-size, prior to surgery, this is a combination 2+7; simply typing 8/other in such cases would be a loss-of-information).\n\n\nThe fields in the therapy.txt file are aimed at collecting post resection therapies and outcomes specifically. Pre-surgery information should be submitted in the \u201cspecimen_donor_treatment_type\u201d field in the specimen.txt file. Using this example, if the patient had chemotherapy to reduce the tumour, and then had surgery to remove it, and this was the source of the specimen sequenced, you can submit chemotherapy in the \u201cspecimen_donor_treatment_type\u201d field, and surgery should be recorded in the \u201cspecimen_donor_treatment_type_other\u201d field (this field is free-text).\n\n\nIf the patient went on to have for example radiotherapy afterwards, this would be entered in the post resection therapy table under \u201cfirst_therapy_type\u201d. Similarly, information about a second post resection therapy can be entered in the \u201csecond_therapy_type\u201d field, and any additional post resection therapies in the \u201cother_therapy\u201d and \u201cother_therapy_response\u201d fields, which are both free text.\n\n\nIf you are not sure if therapy took place before or after the specimen was resected for analyses, please enter the information in the \u201cspecimen_donor_treatment_type_other\u201d as this is free text and you may add a notification that the timing of therapy it is not clear.",
