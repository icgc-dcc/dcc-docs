# Data Releases

## Overview

A DCC data release is a data set produced from clinical and experimental data submitted through the ICGC Data Submission site. (**Someone please update this and provides the proper definition of our data release**)

The *DCC Data Releases* page is where you can browse and download archive data files for every DCC data release in the past. It can be located by clicking/tapping the blue disk icon on the top of the Data Portal site.

Past data releases are listed in table form, from *Release 14* to the most current release. 

Clicking a directory link navigates to the directory containing the release data content. The breadcrumb on the top of the table provides a context of where you are currently within directory hierarchy, and a way to quickly jump back to a particular level in the directory path.

Each directory has a README.txt file, whose content is displayed below the table for your viewing convenience. Starting from *Release 16*, summary information is included in each release archive. For example, the *Release 16* directory shows two sub-directories, *Summary* and *Projects*. Under the *Summary* directory, summary files are available for download; large data files are located in the *Projects* directory. Releases prior to *Release 16* only provide large data files.

Releases prior to *Release 14* can be located via the "legacy\_data\_releases" link below "release\_14". 

Clicking a file link initiates a download - most Web browsers prompt the user for where to save the file.
