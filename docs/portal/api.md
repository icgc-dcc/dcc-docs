# API

## Overview

ICGC API is a set of RESTful endpoints -- programmable interfaces over the Web -- that allows third-party developers to build automation scripts and apps.

Please see [https://dcc.icgc.org/docs/](https://dcc.icgc.org/docs/) for detailed information on the API endpoints, representations and how the API responds to different requests.
