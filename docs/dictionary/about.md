# About

## Overview

The ICGC DCC is tasked with managing the data for the consortium. This data adheres to specific formats and specific restrictions to ensure a standard of quality and correctness.
This is the case for data submitted by partner sites, but also for derived data produced by the DCC.

Validating files needs to be driven by the rules set forth in these dictionaries.
Thus, they are the canonical reference for most of the validation pipeline and other downstream tools.
