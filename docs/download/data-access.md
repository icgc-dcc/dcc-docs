# Apply for Access to Controlled Data


## Data Access Control Bodies

ICGC projects have two separate access control bodies. US based projects are controlled by dbGap, while non-US projects are authorized by the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO). To download controlled data, user must apply for access at corresponding data access control body.

### ICGC DACO

Follow the proceedure outlined at the [DACO](https://icgc.org/daco) page.

Once your DACO access application is completed and approved, your email will become associated with an OpenID, and you will be granted access to the ICGC controlled access datasets available through [Cancer Genome Collaboratory](repositories/#collaboratory), [AWS Virginia](repositories/#aws), the EBIâ€™s [EGA repository](repositories/#ega) and [ICGC Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases).
