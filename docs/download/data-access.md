# Apply for Access to Controlled Data


## Common Data Access Control Bodies

ICGC projects have two separate access control bodies. US based projects are controlled by dbGap, while non-US projects are authorized by the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO). To download controlled data, user must apply for access at corresponding data access control body.

### ICGC DACO

Follow the proceedure outlined at the [DACO page](https://icgc.org/daco).

Once your DACO access application is completed and approved, your email will become associated with an OpenID, and you will be granted access to the ICGC controlled access datasets available through [ICGC Cloud Repositories](repositories/#icgc-clouds), the EBIâ€™s EGA repository and ICGC Data Portal.

### dbGaP
