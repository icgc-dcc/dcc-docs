# Apply for Access to Controlled Data


## Data Access Control Bodies

ICGC projects have two separate access control bodies. US based projects are controlled by dbGap, while non-US projects are authorized by the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO). To download controlled data, user must apply for access at corresponding data access control body.

### Obtaining Access to ICGC-Controlled Data in Data Portal, Collaboratory, AWS and/or EGA 

1. Create an ICGC account at https://icgc.org/user/register
2. Follow the procedure of applying for DACO access at [DACO](https://icgc.org/daco). Please ensure you submit your Gmail email address where it asks for an "OpenID"
3. Submit your DACO application
4. DACO will notify you when your DACO application has been approved, or if they require any further information
5. Once your DACO access application is completed and approved, your email will become associated with an OpenID, and you will be granted access to the ICGC controlled access datasets available through [Cancer Genome Collaboratory](repositories/#collaboratory), [AWS Virginia](repositories/#aws), the EBIâ€™s [EGA repository](repositories/#ega) and [ICGC Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases). EGA will send you (separate) login credentials which you can use to access data in EGA.
