# Apply for Access to Controlled Data


## Data Access Control Bodies

ICGC projects have two separate access control bodies. US based projects are authorized by *dbGaP*, while non-US projects are authorized by the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (*DACO*). To download controlled data, a user must apply for access at the corresponding data access control body. The following table shows you which repository you are able to download from if you have been granted authorization from *dbGaP* or ICGC *DACO*.


| *Authorization From:*  | Data Portal | Collaboratory |  AWS |  EGA  | GDC   |  PDC  |
| :--------------------| ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|   *ICGC DACO*	       |  ![checkmark](images/check_mark.png)  | ![checkmark](images/check_mark.png) | ![checkmark](images/check_mark.png) | ![checkmark](images/check_mark.png) |       |       |

### Obtaining Access to ICGC-Controlled Data in Data Portal, Collaboratory, AWS and/or EGA 

1. Create an ICGC account at [https://icgc.org/user/register](https://icgc.org/user/register)
2. Follow the procedure of applying for DACO access at [DACO](https://icgc.org/daco). **NOTE: Please ensure you submit your Gmail email address where it asks for an "OpenID"**
3. Submit your DACO application. The approval process usually takes 24-48 hours.
4. DACO will notify you when your DACO application has been approved, or if they require any further information
5. Once your DACO access application is completed and approved, your email will become associated with an OpenID, and you will be granted access to the ICGC controlled access datasets available through [Cancer Genome Collaboratory](repositories/#collaboratory), [AWS Virginia](repositories/#aws), the EBI’s [EGA repository](repositories/#ega) and [ICGC Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases). You will recieve an email from EGA about setting up your password to access controlled data at [https://ega-archive.org/](https://ega-archive.org/). If you already had an EGA account from before, you will use the same username/password to access ICGC controlled data at EGA.

### Obtaining Access to dbGaP-Controlled Data in GDC or PDC 

One of the widely used access control system is [database of Genotypes and Phenotypes Authorized Access program](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login). _dbGaP requires an eRA account to log in and register. If you need to register your organization you will need your organization's signing offical to participate in the registration process._

If you encounter difficulties, the [dbGaP help desk](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=email&filter=from&from=login) is available.
